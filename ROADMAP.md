# ROADMAP

Current version: **development**
Next stable release: **1**
Projected release date: --

*This file contains the roadmap towards the next stable release of the specification. It supersedes the older `TODO.md`. 

Please treat this the same as the specification itself: when making changes, make them in a separate branch and only merge into master when discussed with the other contributors.*


## TODO

- [x] Decide on a versioning system
- [ ] Finalise the `design` group [#65](https://github.com/SignalK/specification/pull/65)
- [ ] Finalise the `sensors` group and define it's usage more clearly
- [ ] Review/rewrite the `alarms` group (@rob42)
- [ ] Come up with a `sails` group, remove `sails` from design (@fabdrol)
- [ ] Review the `resources` group
- [ ] Hygiene
  - [ ] Add metadata to all groups (min, max, unit, descriptions, etc)
  - [ ] Review all open PRs and branches, merge where required and remove when not 
  - [ ] Check for FIXMEs
- [ ] Clean-up the repo (`master` branch contains stable spec, `development` branch for active development and topic branches for new features)
- [ ] Update documentation and publish blog posts and news on our first stable release.
