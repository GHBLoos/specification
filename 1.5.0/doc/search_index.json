K Specification","keywords":"","body":"Introduction\nThis is the documentation for the Signal K Specification 1.5.0\nversion, which is available in the following formats;\n\nhtml (this document) 1.5.0\npdf\nepub\nmobi\n\nWhat is Signal K?\nSignal K is a modern and open data format for marine use. It is an Internet friendly standard built on common web\ntechnologies, such as JSON and WebSockets. Signal K is Free and Open Source software. This document is licensed under\nthe Creative Commons CC-BY-SA license. All Signal K source code is\nlicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. Signal K is developed in\nthe open with help from the marine community. Your ideas and feedback are valuable and welcome.\nSignal K is designed to work in harmony with a boat’s existing navigation equipment which may use NMEA0183, NMEA2000 or\nproprietary data protocols, converting and enhancing this information into a modern “web friendly” format which can be\nshared, processed and displayed on the latest web apps, mobile devices and cloud servers. A typical NMEA based\ninstallation consists of an NMEA to Signal K gateway and an optional Signal K server. The gateway translates NMEA data\ninto Signal K format and the server can host additional functions like logging, cloud integration and data analysis.\n\nOne major advantage of Signal K is the ability to represent data from heterogeneous sources. In addition to traditional\nNMEA sources, data from generic sensors as well as modern Signal K enabled sensors can be fused into a single data\nmodel and a single protocol for accessing the data. Another typical configuration is a Signal K server with adapters\nand converters for the different sources.\n\nSignal K Data Model (A.K.A. The Schema)\nThe Signal K Data Model or schema defines a universal model for marine related information and it is specified as a\nJSON schema. See the Signal K Data Model section for details.\nIn traditional marine standards there are many tightly defined messages, each with a specific purpose, but there is no\ndata model to relate them. Furthermore, any device which needs to decode those messages must have a copy of the data\ndictionary in order to do so. By defining a data model in JSON we can make the messaging layer simpler and easily\nextensible. We define consistent units and meta data for each data point in the model. This means that a specific data\npoint (e.g. COG) will always be found at a predictable address.\nIt also means that a display device such as a chartplotter implementing Signal K does not need to know about the data\nmodel beforehand. It can query the central Signal K server on the boat to get all the information it needs to display\nany data point. This metadata may include information such as the unit of measure, minimum and maximum permissible\nvalues, alarm thresholds and localized display name for every data point in the model.\nSignal K Message Format\nSignal K defines methods for combining arbitrary data from the Data Model into valid messages. These messages are in\nUTF-8 JSON format.\nRather than define hundreds of specific messages, Signal K has a few common message formats which can contain any\ncombination of data from the Data Model. This means that there is no need to define new messages for every new data\npoint or command which needs to be supported, rather the message format remains the same and only the data transmitted\nneeds to change. It means that any device can read any message and a device can introduce a new data point which can be\nunderstood by existing devices without the need for firmware upgrades.\nSignal K Transport Layer\nSignal K does not define the transport or wire protocol. Signal K messages are JSON text and can be sent over almost\nany physical transport layer. However, the Signal K standard does provide guidance on how to establish an initial\nconnection, handle negotiation, subscription, and disconnection for a given transport (e.g. TCP/IP or serial).\nWhere possible Signal K uses well established standards like HTTPS, REST, and WebSockets. However, these should not be\ninterpreted as required dependencies of Signal K. It is entirely possible and permissible to implement the protocol\nover any transport that your implementation requires.\nThe goal is to try to establish sensible conventions for each transport in order to make development and\ninterconnection more predictable.\nSignal K Implementations\nThe Signal K project has Open Source reference server implementations in\nNode and Java.\nThere are also several web apps provided by the project which can be installed directly in the Node and Java servers or\ndownloaded from Signal K GitHub. There are also commercial\nSignal K applications and solutions, including mobile apps available\non the Apple App and Android Play Stores, as well as hardware products like iKommunicate.\n"},"start_using.html":{"url":"start_using.html","title":"Using SK","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started Using Signal K\nYou can start using Signal K by\n\nconnecting to the demo server on the Internet with any web browser\ninstalling either the Node or\nJava server on any computer\ngetting some hardware for your boat, such as a Raspberry Pi, suitable\nUSB adapters for your boat’s network (NMEA 0183,\nNMEA 2000 or roll your own with\nI2C sensors) and installing the Node or Java server\npurchasing a commercial Signal K gateway such as an iKommunicate by Digital Yacht\ninstalling OpenPlotter, which includes a Signal K server\n\nOnce you have a server running (or you start by using the demo server) you can install some Signal K supporting mobile\napps such as\n\nWilhelmSK by Scott Bender (iOS)\nNMEARemote by Zapfware (iOS)\nOceanIX (Android)\n\n"},"start_developing.html":{"url":"start_developing.html","title":"Developing with SK","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started in Developing with Signal K\n\nExample HTML5 Applications\nSignal K JavaScript Client\niKommunicate Developer’s Guide\n\n"},"data_model.html":{"url":"data_model.html","title":"Full and Delta Models","keywords":"","body":"Signal K Data Model\nFormats\nSignal K defines two data formats—full and delta—for representing and transmitting data. All Signal K data is\ntransmitted as UTF-8 JSON.\nFull Format\nThe full format is conceptually the simplest representation of data in Signal K. It contains all of the data from a\nSignal K node, which in the case of a Signal K server could be many hundreds of data points.\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"self\": \"urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:705f5f1a-efaf-44aa-9cb8-a0fd6305567c\",\n  \"vessels\": {\n    \"urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:705f5f1a-efaf-44aa-9cb8-a0fd6305567c\": {\n      \"navigation\": {\n        \"speedOverGround\": {\n          \"value\": 4.32693662,\n          \"$source\": \"ttyUSB0.GP\",\n          \"sentence\": \"RMC\",\n          \"timestamp\": \"2017-05-16T05:15:50.007Z\"\n        },\n        \"position\": {\n          \"value\": {\n            \"altitude\": 0.0,\n            \"latitude\": 37.81479,\n            \"longitude\": -122.44880152\n          },\n          \"$source\": \"ttyUSB0.GP\",\n          \"sentence\": \"RMC\",\n          \"timestamp\": \"2017-05-16T05:15:50.007Z\"\n        },\n        \"headingMagnetic\": {\n          \"value\": 5.55014702,\n          \"$source\": \"ttyUSB0.II\",\n          \"sentence\": \"HDM\",\n          \"timestamp\": \"2017-05-16T05:15:54.006Z\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"name\": \"Motu\",\n      \"uuid\": \"urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:705f5f1a-efaf-44aa-9cb8-a0fd6305567c\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"sources\": {\n    \"ttyUSB0\": {\n      \"label\": \"ttyUSB0\",\n      \"type\": \"NMEA0183\",\n      \"GP\": {\n        \"talker\": \"GP\",\n        \"sentences\": {\n          \"RMC\": \"2017-04-03T06:14:04.451Z\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"II\": {\n        \"talker\": \"II\",\n        \"sentences\": {\n          \"HDM\": \"2017-05-16T05:15:54.006Z\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThere are several top level attributes or keys which are always present and others which are optional. The version\nkey specifies which version of the Signal K specification is being used and must always present in a full Signal K\nmodel. Also always present in the full model is the self key. The value of self is the key within the vessels\nobject which is the local boat. Effectively, it is a pointer into the vessels object.\nBelow the vessels object is a list of vessels, identified by their MMSI number or a generated unique ID. There may be\nmany vessels if data has been received from AIS or other sources. The format for each vessel’s data uses the same\nstandard Signal K structure but may not have the same content; likely you will not have as much data about other\nvessels as you have about your own.\nAt the same level as vessels is sources. This contains a list of sources the data was obtained from. Each data\nobject within a vessel may have a $source key which point to a source within sources. Several data objects may\nreference the same source since a single NMEA sentence or PGN may map to multiple keys in Signal K.\nAlternatively the source data may be embedded directly in place of the $source by using the source key:\n{\n  \"vessels\": {\n    \"urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:705f5f1a-efaf-44aa-9cb8-a0fd6305567c\": {\n      \"navigation\": {\n        \"position\": {\n          \"value\": {\n            \"altitude\": 0.0,\n            \"latitude\": 37.81479,\n            \"longitude\": -122.44880152\n          },\n          \"source\": {\n            \"label\": \"ttyUSB0\",\n            \"type\": \"NMEA0183\",\n            \"talker\": \"GP\",\n            \"sentence\": \"PRMC\"\n          },\n          \"timestamp\": \"2017-05-16T05:15:50.007Z\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nFor more information on sources, see the sources section.\nData objects in Signal K are organized hierarchically, for example data related to navigation such as position, speed\nthrough water and heading are all organized under a navigation sub-topic within the vessel object. Each data object\nhas a value property which holds the actual value for that specific key. The value property may contain a number, a\nstring or another object. Signal K keys that are object valued are object valued because the values don‘t have much\nsemantic meaning individually. For example position – latitude doesn‘t have much meaning without an associated\nlongitude. Therefore, these (and altitude) are grouped together in a single navigation.position key.\nThe values are always SI units, and always the same units for the same key. Therefore, speedOverGround is always\nmeters per second, never knots, km/hr, or miles/hr. This means you never have to send units with data, the units are\nspecific for a key, and defined in the data schema. A simplified version of the JSON schema with the units is available\nin Keys Reference in Appendix A. The units are also always specified in the values’\nmetadata which is available via the REST API in the meta.units property.\nBesides the units property, meta provides a lot of other useful information for consumers of the data.\nFinally, each data object also has a timestamp property which represents the time that the value was measured.\nTimestamps are in ISO 8601 format – specifically the RFC 3339 extension format,\nwhich is slightly more strict than the ISO specification.  For instance, it requires four digit years and specifies\nthat T is used as a separator between the data and time portions of the timestamp.\nThe ordering of keys is also not important, they can occur in any order. In fact, if you are designing a device which\nconsumes Signal K data, it is important to remember that the JSON standard does not guarantee the order of properties\nin an object. You MUST NOT rely on the data you receive to always be in the same order within a Signal K message.\nThe full format is most useful for getting the initial state of a Signal K system, for example when a display device\nfirst connects to the network or for refreshing a device‘s state when it loses a network connection.\nHowever sending the full data model is wasteful of both bandwidth and CPU, especially when there is a large amount of\navailable data, or the consuming device is only interested in a small portion of it. In the majority of cases, it is\npreferable to only exchange small, specific portions of the data.\nDelta Format\nBy far, the most commonly produced Signal K format is the delta format. Conceptually, the delta is an update to an\nexisting Signal K data model. A device consuming deltas could either build up a view of the Signal K full tree by\nconsuming and combining deltas or it could request from a Signal K server the current full tree model and apply deltas\nto that as they are received. It is also entirely possible for a device to remain essentially stateless and treat\nSignal K deltas as independent packets of data, much the same way as it would handle NMEA sentences or PGNs.\nAn example delta message is presented below.\n{\n  \"context\": \"vessels.urn:mrn:imo:mmsi:234567890\",\n  \"updates\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": {\n        \"label\": \"N2000-01\",\n        \"type\": \"NMEA2000\",\n        \"src\": \"017\",\n        \"pgn\": 127488\n      },\n      \"timestamp\": \"2010-01-07T07:18:44Z\",\n      \"values\": [\n        {\n          \"path\": \"propulsion.0.revolutions\",\n          \"value\": 16.341667\n        },\n        {\n          \"path\": \"propulsion.0.boostPressure\",\n          \"value\": 45500\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nThe top level of a delta message contains an updates property and an optional context property.\n{\n  \"context\": \"vessels.urn:mrn:imo:mmsi:234567890\",\n  \"updates\": [...]\n}\n\nThe optional context property roots the updates to a particular location in the Signal K tree. If context is\nmissing it is assumed that the data is related to the self context. The self context is the vessel object which\nthe self property of the full model points to.\nContext is a path from the root of the full tree to the container object, which for vessel related data must refer to\na vessel directly under vessels. The delimiter in the context path is . (period). In this case the context is\nvessels.urn:mrn:imo:mmsi:234567890. All subsequent data is relative to that location.\nThe updates property holds a JSON array of update objects, each of which may have a  source property, a timestamp\nproperty and an array of values containing one or more value objects.\n{\n  \"source\": {\n    \"label\": \"N2000-01\",\n    \"type\": \"NMEA2000\",\n    \"src\": \"115\",\n    \"pgn\": 128267\n  },\n  \"timestamp\": \"2014-08-15T16:00:00.081Z\",\n  \"values\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"navigation.courseOverGroundTrue\",\n      \"value\": 2.971\n    },\n    {\n      \"path\": \"navigation.speedOverGround\",\n      \"value\": 3.85\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nAn update has a single source value and it applies to each of the values items. In cases where data can only\ncome from a single source, such as an NMEA 0183 talker connected to a serial port, then the source may be omitted.\nHowever, if the delta is being passed on by a Signal K server or multiplexer then source must be filled in by the\nserver so that downstream consumers can discern where the update comes from.\nIn cases where a Signal K producer does not have access to a real time clock or GPS time then timestamp should be\nomitted. Elements in the Signal K processing chain-such as a server receiving data from a producer-should fill in\ntimestamp if it is missing in the incoming delta message.\nEach value item is then simply a pair of path and value. The path must be a leaf path: it must be a path to\na leaf the of the full model.  A leaf is where the actual value of the Signal K property is and where timestamp,\n$source and values properties are in the full model. The value is often a scalar-a single numeric value, as in the\nexample above-but it can also be an object. For example a navigation.position value would be an object like\n{\"latitude\": -41.2936935424, \"longitude\": 173.2470855712}.\nThere are some static properties in the full model that lack the support for multiple values and metadata such as\nsource and timestamp. An example is a vessel‘s name, directly under the vessel‘s root. This static data may appear in\nthe delta stream, for example when received in AIS transmission. In this case the value should be the subtree of the\nfull model, starting from the vessel's root, with just the relevant parts, and the path must be empty, indicating that\nthe value should be merged to the full model mounted where the delta‘s context property points:\n{\n  \"context\": \"vessels.urn:mrn:imo:mmsi:234567890\",\n  \"updates\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": {...},\n      \"timestamp\": \"2014-08-15T19:02:31.507Z\",\n      \"values\": [\n        {\n          \"path\": \"\",\n          \"value\": {\n            \"name\": \"WRANGO\"\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nData Quality\nData transmitted in Signal K format is assumed to be corrected for known sensor inaccuracies such as wind angle offset\ndue to misalignment of a masthead unit on the mast, but there is no guarantee that data is accurate, or within\ncertain bounds. Different sources will have different data quality and normal vigilance is always required.\nMissing or Invalid Data\nA sensor or gateway/server may want to send a message indicating known invalid data or the fact that the sensor is\nfunctioning but can not provide data, for example when a depth sensor has no bottom fix. In this case the value must be\nJSON null in the delta message and the server must return the value as a JSON null in the REST API.\nMessage Integrity\nMany messaging systems specify checksums or other forms of message integrity checking. Signal K assumes a reliable\ntransport will guarantee a valid message. This is true of TCP/IP and some other transports but not always the case. For\nother transports (e.g. RS-232 serial) a specific extended data format will apply, which is suited to that transport.\nHence at the message level no checksum or other tests need to be made.\nEncoding/Decoding\nThe JSON message format is supported across most programming environments and can be handled with any convenient\nlibrary.\nOn micro-controllers with limited RAM it may be necessary to read and write Signal K data using a streaming process\nrather than reading the entire message into RAM before processing. There is an implementation of Signal K JSON\nstreaming on an Arduino Mega (4K RAM) in the related\nFreeboard project.\n"},"data_model_multiple_values.html":{"url":"data_model_multiple_values.html","title":"Multiple Values","keywords":"","body":"Multiple Values for a Key\nThere are two use cases for multiple values for a single data point\n\nMultiple instances of a common device-e.g. two engines or multiple batteries.\nMultiple devices providing duplicate data-multiple values for the same Signal K key from different sensors. This is\nfairly common as most boats have multiple sensors capable of generating the same data (but not necessarily the same\nvalue). For example, course over ground (COG) may come from both a compass and GPS or a boat may be equipped with\nmultiple depth sounders.\n\nMultiple Instances of a Common Device\nSome parts of the Signal K schema are device oriented.\nFor example, many boats have multiple batteries. However each battery has multiple, common quantities like voltage,\ncurrent and temperature. In this case, it makes more sense for these values to be organized by instance. Therefore, in\nthe Signal K model, each battery bank is it’s own instance: for example electrical.batteries.starter and\nelectrical.batteries.house. Then beneath that prefix there are the various properties for each battery.\nThis organisation allows a user interface to organise the individual readings in meaningful groups and allows consumers\nto query all the values related to that piece of equipment via the REST API. Furthermore, this structure maintains the\nprimary requirement that a given data value have a fixed and unique URI, but gives flexibility in the structure and\ncomplexities of data.\nThe same device centric organisation is used within the propulsion subschema, to support the common use case of two\nengines via propulsion.port and propulsion.starboard.\n\nThe values starter, house, port and starboard are examples and not specified in the schema. You are free to\nuse application specific values within the regexp specified in the JSON schema.\n\nMultiple Devices Providing Duplicate Data\nIt is quite possible for a key value to come from more than one device. Many modern devices have a built in GPS\nreceiver and as a result on any given boat there may be several sources of position, speed over ground, and heading.\nMultiple depth sounders are also common, often installed to port and starboard on monohull sailboats or in each hull of\na catamaran.\nGiven that the validity of these various sources of data may change in a context-specific way, Signal K provides a\nmechanism for these values to be grouped together so that the consumer of the data may choose which value (or values)\nto display1.\nWhen dealing with multiple sources of data, it becomes important to know where the data is coming from. Signal K\nprovides a mechanism for that in the form of the sources top level object and references into that object via the\n$source property. See sources for detailed information on the structure of the sources object and how\nit is referenced by the $source property.\nThe first source of a particular data point becomes the default source for that data and a normal Signal K object is\ncreated.\n{\n  \"self\": \"urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:c0d79334-4e25-4245-8892-54e8ccc8021d\",\n  \"version\": \"0.9.0\",\n  \"vessels\": {\n    \"urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:c0d79334-4e25-4245-8892-54e8ccc8021d\": {\n      \"uuid\": \"urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:c0d79334-4e25-4245-8892-54e8ccc8021d\",\n      \"navigation\": {\n        \"courseOverGroundTrue\": {\n          \"value\": 3.61562407843144,\n          \"$source\": \"ttyUSB0.GP\",\n          \"timestamp\": \"2017-04-03T06:14:04.451Z\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nIt has come from device sources.ttyUSB0.GP, where further details can be found.\nIf another value with different source arrives, the Signal K server will add the values attribute with values from\nboth the first and second sources.

The source reference should be enclosed in square brackets:\nnavigation.courseOverGroundTrue.values[n2k./dev/ikommunicate.128267]. The client can retrieve the relevant data via\nREST API.\nNote: The exact format of the update message is affected by the subscription policy. A policy of instant will\nresult in changes being sent immediately, so typically one item in values per update. A policy of fixed will result\nin periodic updates which may contain many items in values.\nThe update allows grouping values by source.\n\n[1] Specifying preferred sources is still an under-development enhancement to the Node\nserver.\n"},"data_model_metadata.html":{"url":"data_model_metadata.html","title":"Metadata","keywords":"","body":"Metadata\nA key part of Signal K is the ability for data consumers such as apps or MFDs to automatically configure themselves\nbased on settings retrieved from the server.

A crew member may bring a personal\ntablet with them for their tactician role during a Wednesday evening race or a harbor pilot may bring a laptop on board\nloaded with local charts.

Note that a power of\n0.5 is equivalent to squareroot and a power of 1 is equivalent to linear. In using these scales the type defines the\nfunction which is applied to all values in order to calculate % scale deflection of the pointer/needle/plot:\n\n\n\nType\nFormula for % deflection\n\n\n\n\nlinear\n(V - L)/(U - L)\n\n\nlogarithmic\n(log(V) - log(L) / (log(U) - log(L))\n\n\nsquareroot\n(√V - √L) / (√U - √L)\n\n\npower (P)\n(Vᴾ - Lᴾ) / (Uᴾ - Lᴾ)\n\n\n\nWhere: V = value, L = lower bound of the gauge, U = upper bound of the gauge and P = power\nNote that on a logarithmic scale neither L nor U can be zero. \nThe alertMethod, warnMethod, alarmMethod and\nemergencyMethod properties tell the consumer how it should respond to an abnormal data condition. Presently the\nvalues for these properties are sound and visual and the method is specified as an array containing one or both of\nthese options. It is up to the consumer to decide how to convey these alerts.\nalertMethod, etc\nThe alertMethod, warnMethod, alarmMethod and emergencyMethod properties tell the consumer how it should respond to an\nabnormal data condition. Presently the values for these properties are sound and visual and the method is specified as an\narray containing one or both of these options. It is up to the consumer to decide how to convey these alerts.\nzones\nThe last property in the meta object is the zones array. This provides a series of hints to the consumer which can\nbe used to properly set a range on a display gauge and also color sectors of a gauge to indicate normal or dangerous\noperating conditions. It also tells the consumer which state the data is in for a given range. Combined with the alert\nmethod properties, all Signal K consumers can react the same way to a given state.\nThe possible states in ascending order of severity are:\n\n\n\nState/Zone\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nnominal\nthis is a special type of normal state/zone (see below)\n\n\nnormal\nthe normal operating range for the value in question (default)\n\n\nalert\nIndicates a safe or normal condition which is brought to the operators attention to impart information for routine action purposes\n\n\nwarn\nIndicates a condition that requires immediate attention but not immediate action\n\n\nalarm\nIndicates a condition which is outside the specified acceptable range. Immediate action is required to prevent loss of life or equipment damage\n\n\nemergency\nthe value indicates a life-threatening condition\n\n\n\nnominal: A example use of this is for engine monitoring eg. coolant temperature where there is a normal (no warnings)\n(green) zone between say 70C and 110C, but when the temperature is between 80C and 90C (nominal) the needle doesn't move at\nall (typically remains vertical or horizontal). This is really useful if you have many gauges (multiple motors with multiple\nsensors) where it is very easy to spot that every needle is pointing in exactly the same direction. Use of nominal will only\nbe relevant if the gauge/display design permits it.\nThe upper and lower values in the zones do not need to be contiguous, they don't have to both be present in a zone, nor do\nthey need to be within the bounds of the upper and lower specified in displayScale. When they are outside of the\ndisplayScale range they will still give rise to alerts. Both upper and lower values are considered to be inclusive.\nIf zones overlap each other the state/zone with the highest severity will take precedence. This is true for both alerts and\ngauge/display rendering. Any part of the range which is not explicitly within a zone is considered to be normal (the default).\nAs such, zones with a state of normal have no effect and their removal would result in no changes to either displays or alerts.\nThere can be multiple zones with the same state, for example if a different message is required, or if they are on different parts of the scale.\nSignal K servers will use the zone information to monitor any data which has a meta object and\nraise a generic alarm event. See the section on Alarm Handling for more.\nImplicit Metadata\nAll keys in the Signal K specification must have a description, and where the key is a numeric value it must have\nunits.\nIf a client requests the meta property for a valid Signal K key via the HTTP REST interface, the server must return\nthe description and, if applicable, units, even if no value has ever been generated for that key.\nIf a key has values determined by an enum, the server should include the enum in the meta. NB. in future versions\nit is likely that this will become a mandatory requirement for the server.\n// GET /signalk/v1/api/vessels/self/environment/depth/belowKeel/meta\n\n{\n  \"units\": \"m\",\n  \"description\": \"Depth below keel\"\n}\n\nSee keyswithmetadata.json\nDefault Configuration\nSignal K does not provide a default set of metadata, it is up to the owner or their installer to configure their Signal\nK environment appropriately for their vessel. However, by centralizing this configuration they will only need to do it\none time and any future consumers will automatically use this configuration.\nAlarm Management\nAn alarm watch is set by setting the meta.zones array appropriately. A background process on the server checks for\nalarm conditions on any attribute with a meta.zones array. If the keys value is within a zone the server sets an\nalarm key similar to vessels.self.notifications.[original_key_suffix], e.g. an alarm set on\nvessels.self.navigation.courseOverGroundTrue will become\nvessels.self.notifications.navigation.courseOverGroundTrue.\nThe object found at this key should contain the following:\n{\n  \"message\": \"any text\",\n  \"state\": \"[normal|alert|warn|alarm|emergency]\"\n}\n\nOther Benefits\nWhile not strictly part of the Signal K specification, metadata configuration could be shared between boats or even\nprovided by manufacturers of production boats or by component suppliers such as engine or refrigerator manufacturers.\nAlso, any device which implements Signal K should provide a baseline metadata configuration. As this standard becomes\nmore widespread, less individual configuration will need to be performed.\n"},"sources.html":{"url":"sources.html","title":"Sources","keywords":"","body":"Signal K Data Sources\nSignal K provides a method to identify the specific device and—if available—the NMEA sentence or PGN which generated a\nparticular value. This is handled in two ways. The first is with a pointer to a device in the sources section of the\nSignal K data model. When viewing a full Signal K data model, this is the method you will see. Every Signal K data\nobject will have a $source property (note the dollar sign sigil which indicates the value is a pointer) which\ncontains a dot separated path to an object relative to the top-level sources section. When receiving Signal K data\nvia deltas, you may also see sources referenced this way. However, all current implementations of Signal K provide\nsource data directly embedded in the delta message. This is done using the source property of the delta message.\nPointer Method\nAn example of the pointer method is shown below.\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"self\": \"vessels.urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:705f5f1a-efaf-44aa-9cb8-a0fd6305567c\",\n  \"vessels\": {\n    \"urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:705f5f1a-efaf-44aa-9cb8-a0fd6305567c\": {\n      \"uuid\": \"urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:705f5f1a-efaf-44aa-9cb8-a0fd6305567c\",\n      \"navigation\": {\n        \"speedOverGround\": {\n          \"value\": 4.32693662,\n          \"$source\": \"ttyUSB0.GP\",\n          \"sentence\": \"RMC\",\n          \"timestamp\": \"2017-05-16T05:15:50.007Z\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"sources\": {\n    \"ttyUSB0\": {\n      \"label\": \"ttyUSB0\",\n      \"type\": \"NMEA0183\",\n      \"GP\": {\n        \"talker\": \"GP\",\n        \"sentences\": {\n          \"RMC\": \"2017-04-03T06:14:04.451Z\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nThis is a full Signal K model with a single data source and a single data object. The navigation.speedOverGround\nobject references the ttyUSB0.GP device via the value of the $source property. In addition to $source, the\nsentence property is also included which identifies the specific NMEA 0183 sentence recieved from the data source\nwhich was converted to Signal K.\nWithin the sources section devices are conventionally organized by the physical connection to the Signal K device and\nan identifier for the specific source device. In the case above, the first level of the hierarchy is the UNIX device\nidentifier for a USB serial port and the second level is the NMEA 0183 talker ID of the paddlewheel sensor.\nDirect Inclusion Method\nThis method is only implemented in delta messages. An example delta with an inline source is shown below.\n{\n  \"updates\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": {\n        \"label\": \"ttyUSB0\",\n        \"type\": \"NMEA2000\",\n        \"pgn\": 127251,\n        \"src\": \"204\"\n      },\n      \"timestamp\": \"2017-04-15T20:38:26.709Z\",\n      \"values\": [\n        {\n          \"path\": \"navigation.rateOfTurn\",\n          \"value\": -0.000412469\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"context\": \"vessels.urn:mrn:imo:mmsi:338184312\"\n}\n\nThis particular source is an NMEA 2000 device so it has the pgn and src properties, but NMEA 0183 or other source\ntypes are similarly supported. An NMEA 0183 source would be structured like this:\n{\n  \"label\": \"NMEA0183-0\",\n  \"type\": \"NMEA0183\",\n  \"sentence\": \"RMC\",\n  \"talker\": \"GP\"\n}\n\nA final example using a non-NMEA source, in this case an I²C sensor.\n{\n  \"type\": \"I2C\",\n  \"label\": \"I²C Bus #0\",\n  \"src\": \"14\"\n}\n\nHere, src is the address of the device on the I²C bus.\nSources Group\nA Signal K device capable of generating a full data model will have a top level (i.e. at the same level as vessels,\nversion and self) group called sources. This group provides detailed information about each network bus connected\nto the Signal K gateway or server. Sources are organized hierarchically, following a bus-source-type structure.\nAn example of multiple sources is shown below.\n{\n  \"vhf\": {\n    \"label\": \"AIS Receiver\",\n    \"type\": \"VHF\",\n    \"112334556\": {\n      \"ais\": {\n        \"aisType\": 15\n      }\n    },\n    \"394299113\": {\n      \"ais\": {\n        \"aisType\": 15\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"ttyUSB0\": {\n    \"label\": \"NMEA 0183\",\n    \"type\": \"NMEA0183\",\n    \"II\": {\n      \"talker\": \"II\",\n      \"sentences\": {\n        \"VHW\": \"2018-04-16T01:34:03.881Z\"\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"ttyUSB1\": {\n    \"label\": \"NMEA 2000\",\n    \"type\": \"NMEA2000\",\n    \"3\": {\n      \"1\": {},\n      \"2\": {},\n      \"n2k\": {\n        \"src\": \"3\",\n        \"pgns\": {\n          \"126992\": \"2017-04-15T18:44:59.006Z\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nYou may notice two odd lines in the NMEA 2000 source \"3\": \"1\": {} and \"2\": {}'. These are placeholders for NMEA\n2000 \"instance\" values. These are here to provide a valid schema for certain NMEA 2000 PGNs relating to temperature.\nBecause temperature paths in the current versio of Signal K do not have the instance inline, consumers must look at the\ninstance part of the $source or source property to determine which specific sensor provided the data.\n"},"urls_ports.html":{"url":"urls_ports.html","title":"URLs and Ports","keywords":"","body":"URLs and Ports\nWhile Signal K is a transport-agnistic protocol, there are certain conventions that have been established for use on\nthe Web and by clients and servers using HTTP and WebSockets.\nPorts\nThe Signal K HTTP and WebSocket services SHOULD be found on the usual HTTP/S ports (80 or 443).

E.g. for a raw TCP\nconnection the connection causes the above message to be sent, and sending the subscribe messages will have the same\neffect as described here.\n\nThis can be a lot of messages, many you may not need, especially if your boat has many sensors, or other data sources.\nOften you will want to subscribe to a much smaller range of data. Especially for single value displays, it does not\nmake sense to get the entire data stream when only a single value is wanted.\nFirst you will want to unsubscribe from the current default (or you may have already connected with\nws://hostname/signalk/v1/stream?subscribe=none). To unsubscribe all create an unsubscribe message with wildcards\nand send the message over the WebSocket connection:\n{\n  \"context\": \"*\",\n  \"unsubscribe\": [\n    {\"path\": \"*\"}\n  ]\n}\n\nTo subscribe to the required criteria send a suitable subscribe message:\n{\n  \"context\": \"vessels.self\",\n  \"subscribe\": [\n    {\n      \"path\": \"navigation.speedThroughWater\",\n      \"period\": 1000,\n      \"format\": \"delta\",\n      \"policy\": \"ideal\",\n      \"minPeriod\": 200\n    },\n    {\n      \"path\": \"navigation.logTrip\",\n      \"period\": 10000\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\npath=[path.to.key] is appended to the context to specify subsets of the context.\nThe path value can use the wildcard *. A wildcard in the middle of a path (propulsion/*/oilTemperature) allows any\nvalue for that part and a wildcard at the end (propulsion/port/*) matches all paths beginning with the specified\nprefix.\n\nThe following are optional, included above only for example as it uses defaults anyway:\n\nperiod=[millisecs] becomes the transmission rate, e.g. every period/1000 seconds. Default: 1000\nformat=[delta|full] specifies delta or full format. Default: delta\npolicy=[instant|ideal|fixed]. Default: ideal\ninstant means send all changes as fast as they are received, but no faster than minPeriod. With this policy the\n client has an immediate copy of the current state of the server.\nideal means use instant policy, but if no changes are received before period, then resend the last known\nvalues.\nfixed means simply send the last known values every period.\n\n\nminPeriod=[millisecs] becomes the fastest message transmission rate allowed, e.g. every minPeriod/1000 seconds.\n  This is only relevant for policy='instant' to avoid swamping the client or network.\n\nYou can subscribe to multiple data keys multiple times, from multiple apps or devices. Each app or device simply\nsubscribes to the data it requires, and the server and/or client implementation may combine subscriptions to avoid\nduplication as it prefers on a per connection basis. At the same time it is good practice to open the minimum\nconnections necessary, for instance one WebSocket connection shared between an instrument panel with many gauges,\nrather then one WebSocket connection per gauge.\nMultiple value handling in subscriptions\nA subscription to a key is for all the updates to that key. If there are multiple sources generating data for that key\nthe client will get all their updates.\nIf a client wants only the values of a single source it should subscribe to a path that includes the full path under\nvalues including the source reference key of the source.

Alarms, alerts and notifications are\nall handled the same way, and are all referred to as alarms below.\nWe need a flexible model to define alarm conditions, and a standard way to announce and record them.\nAlarm Process\n\nDefine alarm states as zones in the meta object attached to any Signal K value. See [[Metadata for Data Values]]\nIf the value is within an alarm zone raise the defined alarm.\nIf the value goes out of the zone, remove the alarm by setting its value to null\nAlarms are raised by placing an alarm object in the vessels.self.notifications tree\n\nExpected implementation behaviour\n\nThe server (or device) should monitor the current value and compare it to the defined zones.\nIf a value enters an alarm zone, then a key is written to vessels.self.notifications..\nIf a value leaves an alarm zone, then the key is removed from vessels.self.notifications..\nAlarms raised are monitored by an alarm process on the server, which takes appropriate action, sounding alarms, or\ndisplaying messages.\nClients interested in alarms can subcribe to the vessels.self.notifications... tree in the usual way and be informed\nof alarms in the same way as normal signalk keys.\nWhen an alarms is removed, a delta should be sent to subscribers with the path and a null value.\n\nExample\neg If we exceed our anchor alarm radius: vessels.self.navigation.anchor.currentRadius enters\nvessels.self.navigation.anchor.currentRadius.meta.zones : [ {lower: \"0\", upper: maxRadius, state : \"normal\"}, {lower: maxRadius, upper: 999999, state: \"alarm\"}]\nThe alarm is : vessels.self.notifications.navigation.anchor.currentRadius\nThe alarm object is\n{\n  \"value\": {\n    \"method\": [\"sound\"],\n    \"state\": \"alarm\",\n    \"message\": \"Dragging anchor!\"\n  },\n  \"timestamp\": \"...\",\n  \"$source\": \"...\"\n}\nThe server alarm manager will see this new entry and turn on the alarm. Using a manager process allows flexibility in\nsituations where multiple alarms are triggered and your vessel is a mass of flashing and beeping. eg A single 'Pause'\nbutton can give you 5-10 minutes to take action, stopping annoying noise, and removing popup messages from screens.\nSince the vessels.self.notifications tree mirrors the other data in the signal k model, we can selectively watch or\nreact to specific branches or keys. When displaying multiple alarms a screen can also sort and filter them.\nOther Alarms\nAbove we have discussed monitoring existing values and raising alarms. There are other alarms that must be considered,\neg MOB, fire, sinking etc, and misc alerts \"GPS signal lost\".etc.\nThe vessels.[uuid].notifications tree is the same as any other Signal k branch. Keys can be added and removed as\nrequired in the usual way. Since the branch is being monitored we only need to add a key of any sort to create a\nsuitable alarm.\nIn the case of an emergency, create a unique key: The alarm is : vessels.[uuid].notifications.[alarm.key]\nThe alarm object is\n{\n  \"value\": {\n    \"method\": [\"visual\", \"sound\"],\n    \"state\": \"emergency\",\n    \"message\": \"Man Overboard!\"\n  },\n  ...\n}\nAlarm objects that have been raised this way must be cleared manually, or by the process that created them. You can use\nany suitable path, keeping in mind the context of the alarm.\neg In the case of an alert, create a unique key by generating a path: The alarm is :\nvessels.[uuid].notifications.navigation.gnss\nThe alarm object is\n{\n  \"value\": {\n    \"method\": [\"visual\"],\n    \"state\": \"alert\",\n    \"message\": \"GPS signal lost!\"\n  },\n  ...\n}\nWell Known Names\nSome alarms are especially important, eg MOB. This is a list of keys for special alarms.\n\n..notifications.mob.*\n..notifications.fire.*\n..notifications.sinking.*\n..notifications.flooding.*\n..notifications.collision.*\n..notifications.grounding.*\n..notifications.listing.*\n..notifications.adrift.*\n..notifications.piracy.*\n..notifications.abandon.*\n\nAn example to send an MOB alarm from an N2K source, the gateway would convert and send something like:\n{\n  \"context\": \"vessels.urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:c0d79334-4e25-4245-8892-54e8ccc8021d\",\n  \"updates\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": {...},\n      \"timestamp\": \"2017-08-15T16:00:05.200Z\",\n      \"values\": [\n        {\n          \"path\": \"notifications.mob\",\n          \"value\": {\n            \"message\": \"MOB\",\n            \"state\": \"emergency\",\n            \"method\": [\"visual\", \"sound\"]\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\nThe resulting full signalk tree would be:\n{\n  \"vessels\": {\n    \"urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:c0d79334-4e25-4245-8892-54e8ccc8021d\": {\n      \"uuid\": \"...\",\n      \"notifications\": {\n        \"mob\": {\n          \"value\": {\n            \"method\": [\"visual\", \"sound\"],\n            \"state\": \"emergency\",\n            \"message\": \"Man Overboard!\"\n          },\n          \"timestamp\": \"2017-04-10T08:33:53Z\",\n          \"$source\": \"...\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  ...\n}\nTo clear the alarm condition, send:\n{\n  \"context\": \"vessels.urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:c0d79334-4e25-4245-8892-54e8ccc8021d\",\n  \"updates\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": {...},\n      \"timestamp\": \"2017-08-15T16:00:05.538Z\",\n      \"values\": [\n        {\n          \"path\": \"notifications.mob\",\n          \"value\": null\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\nMultiple cases of the same alarm\nShould multiple cases of the same alarm occur (eg a gps loses signal, then a second gps loses signal) the alarms are\nhandled the same as any other multiple values in signalk. However alarms will tend to be re-issued whenever the\nunderlying data changes.\nThe servers alarm monitoring processes are expected to be smart enough to know that the anchor alarm is triggered, and\nits not necessary to raise a second copy of the same alarm, after all there is only one boat dragging!\nThis may be handled differently for notifications. It may be useful to know that your gps's are all failing\nintermittently, or that . Hence the handling of multiple copies of alarms is an implementation issue, and may vary.\nThe key should be unique\nIf we have an alarm vessels.self.notifications.navigation.anchor.currentRadius and we attempt to write another higher\nin the same tree at vessels.self.notifications it must not replace or remove the existing alarm. Since the\nmeta.zones structure is only valid on signalk leaf values this occurs naturally in most circumstances. But it is\npossible to set an alarm value arbitrarily (eg MOB) and care should be taken in implementations that keys do not\noverwrite existing paths.\n"},"security.html":{"url":"security.html","title":"Security","keywords":"","body":"Security\nCommunications Security\nFor privacy and data integrity REST and WebSockets communications should be secured with Transport Layer Security\n(TLS).

This is the fundamental building block of SchemaVer, and explains the divergence from Semantic Versioning.\nHeres a simple formula for our SchemaVer:\nGiven a version number MODEL.REVISION.ADDITION-SUFFIX, increment the:\n\nMODEL - when you make a breaking schema change which will prevent interaction with any historical data\nREVISION - when you make a schema change which may prevent interaction with some historical data\nADDITION - when you make a schema change that is compatible with all historical data\nSUFFIX - optional - denotes special versions or active development eg alpha-1, SNAPSHOT\n\nThe first released version of Signal K will be 1.0.0.\n\nThe current development version will then move to be 1.0.1-SNAPSHOT\nThe next release candidate might then be 1.0.1-alpha-1\nThe current development version will then move to be 1.0.2-SNAPSHOT\n\nSNAPSHOT denotes a version under active change. If you depend on the SNAPSHOT version then every time you build your project it will have changed with what-ever was committed since last time you checked.\nLet’s make SchemaVer more concrete with some examples using some (truncated and contrived) Signal K Schemas, in reverse order:\nAddition\nWe have an existing JSON Schema, let’s call this 1.0.0:\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\",\n  \"id\": \"https://signalk.org/demospecification/1.0.0/schemas/groups/communication.json#\",\n  \"description\": \"Schema describing the communication child-object of a Vessel.\",\n  \"title\": \"communication\",\n  \"properties\": {\n      \"dscAddress\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"MMSI Callsign for VHF communication\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"dscAddress\"],\n  \"additionalProperties\": false\n}\nNow we want to add an additional field to our schema:\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\",\n  \"id\": \"https://signalk.org/demospecification/1.0.1/schemas/groups/communication.json#\",\n  \"description\": \"Schema describing the communication child-object of a Vessel.\",\n  \"title\": \"communication\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"dscAddress\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"MMSI Callsign for VHF communication\"\n    },\n    \"phoneNumber\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"Phone number of skipper\",\n      \"example\": \"+64xxxxxx\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"dscAddress\"],\n  \"additionalProperties\": false\n}\nBecause our new phoneNumber field is not a required field, and because version 1.0.0 had additionalProperties set to false, we know that all historical data will work with this new schema, ie. any json which validates against 1.0.0 will also be valid against 1.0.1.\nTherefore we are looking at an ADDITION, and so we bump the schema version to 1.0.1.\nRevision\nLet’s now make our JSON Schema support additionalProperties - this constitutes another ADDITION, so we are now on 1.0.2:\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\",\n  \"id\": \"https://signalk.org/demospecification/1.0.2/schemas/groups/communication.json#\",\n  \"description\": \"Schema describing the communication child-object of a Vessel.\",\n  \"title\": \"communication\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"dscAddress\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"MMSI Callsign for VHF communication\"\n    },\n    \"phoneNumber\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"Phone number of skipper\",\n      \"example\": \"+64xxxxxx\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"dscAddress\"],\n  \"additionalProperties\": true\n}\nAfter a while, we add a new field, callsignHf:\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\",\n  \"id\": \"https://signalk.org/demospecification/1.1.0/schemas/groups/communication.json#\",\n  \"description\": \"Schema describing the communication child-object of a Vessel.\",\n  \"title\": \"communication\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"dscAddress\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"MMSI Callsign for VHF communication\"\n    },\n    \"phoneNumber\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"Phone number of skipper\",\n      \"example\": \"+64xxxxxx\"\n    },\n    \"callsignHf\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"Callsign for HF communication\",\n      \"example\": \"ZL3RTH\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"dscAddress\"],\n  \"additionalProperties\": true\n}\nWill this new schema validate all historical data? Unfortunately we can’t be certain, because there could be historical JSONs where the analyst added their own callsignHf field which was not a string.\nSo we are effectively making a REVISION to the data schema - so we bump the version to 1.1.0 (resetting ADDITION to 0).\nModel\nOh dear - we have just realized that not every-one has DSC! It should have been a VHF callsign. Here is our new JSON Schema:\n{\n  \"type\": \"object\",\n  \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\",\n  \"id\": \"https://signalk.org/demospecification/2.0.0/schemas/groups/communication.json#\",\n  \"description\": \"Schema describing the communication child-object of a Vessel.\",\n  \"title\": \"communication\",\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"callsignVhf\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"Callsign for VHF communication\",\n      \"example\": \"ZL1234\"\n    },\n    \"phoneNumber\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"Phone number of skipper\",\n      \"example\": \"+64xxxxxx\"\n    },\n    \"callsignHf\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"description\": \"Callsign for HF communication\",\n      \"example\": \"ZL3RTH\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"required\": [\"callsignVhf\"],\n  \"additionalProperties\": false\n}\nWe have changed our MODEL - because we can have no reasonable expectation that any of the historical data can interact with this schema. That means our new version is 2.0.0\nNote that we also decided to use this “reboot” of the MODEL to change additionalProperties back to false, because (as we have learnt) it will help us to avoid unnecessary REVISIONs in the future.\nNote: https://signalk.org/demospecification/... is not real, it is just used here for illustration. The real schemas are located at: https://signalk.org/specification/...\nSupplementary rules\nIn Signal K we have a few variations from SchemaVer:\n\nWe use dots (.) to separate the version parts, not hyphens (-s) as in SchemaVer\nWe use a suffix to denote in-progress or special releases, as commonly seen in Maven\n\n"},"access_requests.html":{"url":"access_requests.html","title":"Appendix E: Access Requests","keywords":"","body":"Access Requests\nWhen a device needs to gain access to a secured Signal K server, it can use Access Requests to request and be\ngranted access to the server.\nSee Request/Response for more information on request/response semantics.\nA device could be a display or for example an engine sensor or a temperature sensor.\nDefinitions\n\nclientId is a string that uniquely identifies a device.
